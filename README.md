### Verifying Installer Integrity (Checksums and Signatures)

#### Windows Installer Verification
1. Download the SHA256 checksum file from the official website
   - Look for files named `gimp-*-setup.exe.sha256`
   - Save both installer and checksum in the same directory
   - Note the expected checksum value

2. Use PowerShell to verify:
   ```powershell
   # Method 1: Using Get-FileHash
   Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 gimp-installer.exe | Compare-Object (Get-Content checksum.txt)

   # Method 2: Manual verification
   $hash = Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 gimp-installer.exe
   $expected = Get-Content checksum.txt
   if ($hash.Hash -eq $expected) { Write-Host "Verification successful" }
   ```

3. Troubleshooting:
   - If checksums don't match, download the file again
   - Check for download interruptions
   - Verify you're using the correct checksum file
   - Ensure file wasn't modified during download

#### macOS Package Verification
1. Check the package signature:
   ```bash
   # Verify the package signature
   pkgutil --check-signature GIMP.pkg

   # Check the certificate
   security find-certificate -a -c "GIMP" -Z
   ```

2. Verify SHA256 checksum:
   ```bash
   # Calculate checksum
   shasum -a 256 GIMP.pkg

   # Compare with provided checksum
   echo "expected_checksum GIMP.pkg" | shasum -a 256 -c
   ```

3. Additional Security Checks:
   - Verify the developer certificate
   - Check Gatekeeper settings
   - Review security permissions
   - Scan for malware (optional)

#### Linux Package Verification
1. Verify GPG signature:
   ```bash
   # Import the GIMP public key
   gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 0x7B44D54E

   # Verify the signature
   gpg --verify gimp-*.tar.bz2.sig

   # Check the key fingerprint
   gpg --fingerprint 0x7B44D54E
   ```

2. Check SHA256 checksum:
   ```bash
   # Verify the checksum
   sha256sum -c gimp-*.tar.bz2.sha256

   # Manual verification
   sha256sum gimp-*.tar.bz2
   ```

3. Package Manager Verification:
   ```bash
   # Debian/Ubuntu
   apt-key list | grep GIMP
   
   # Fedora
   rpm -qa | grep gpg-pubkey
   ```
